Create a web page that displays the Function Toolkit.
This should be done with a table. 
Create a folder in your ~/html/ directory called "functiontoolkit"
Create another folder called "img/"
Create an index.html file ~/html/functiontoolkit/
Create a table that is 3 columns by 13 rows.
All code should be html. You need to figure out how to do super-script, sub-script and square root (second root).
The only graphics on this page are the function graphs.
Create all graphs using a function graphing utility such as wolfram alpha.

Then screen shot the graphics and edit them with gimp.
The page should look like the pdf located in this repo.
